# Task
write code for Real-Time Vital Sign Monitoring and Automated Alert Notifications using XGBoost and using given csv file as training dataset for colab and I download the colab into ipynb and give it as a train model to my django project

Here is all the data you need:
"human_vital_signs_dataset_2024.csv"

## Data loading

### Subtask:
Load the "human_vital_signs_dataset_2024.csv" file into a Pandas DataFrame.

**Reasoning**:
Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame named `df`.
"""

### Subtask:
Explore the dataset loaded in `df`.

**Reasoning**:
Explore the dataset by examining its shape, data types, descriptive statistics, missing values, and the distribution of numerical features.

### Subtask:
Clean the data in the DataFrame `df`.

Check for and handle potential missing values, identify and handle outliers, remove irrelevant columns, and check for duplicate rows.

"""## Feature engineering

### Subtask:
Engineer new features from the cleaned data in `df` to improve the performance of the XGBoost model for vital sign monitoring.

Provide instructions on how to integrate the saved model into a Django project.


"""

# Instructions for integrating the model into a Django project:

# 1. Install necessary libraries in your Django environment:
#    - xgboost
#    - pandas
#    - scikit-learn (if needed)
#    - pickle (already installed)

# 2. Create a view function to handle predictions:
#    - Load the saved model using pickle.load().
#    - Extract relevant input features from the user's request (e.g., from a form submission).
#    - Preprocess the input features (similar to the training data preprocessing).
#    - Use the loaded model to make predictions on the preprocessed input.
#    - Return the prediction results to the user.

# 3. Consider model deployment:
#    - You can deploy the model as a separate service (e.g., using a REST API) or integrate it directly into a view function.
#    - A separate service might offer better scalability and performance, while integration into a view function might be simpler to implement.

# 4. Download the model file:
#    - From Colab, you can download the 'xgboost_vital_signs_model.pkl' file to your local machine.
#    - Upload this file to your Django project's directory.

# Example (simplified) code snippet for a view function:
# def predict_vital_signs(request):
#     if request.method == 'POST':
#         # Extract input features from the request
#         # ...
#
#         # Load the model
#         with open('xgboost_vital_signs_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
#             model = pickle.load(f)
#
#         # Preprocess the input features (standardize, etc.)
#         # ...
#
#         # Make predictions
#         prediction = model.predict(input_features)
#
#         # Return the prediction
#         return JsonResponse({'prediction': prediction})
#     else:
#         return render(request, 'your_template.html')  # Render a form for input

# Remember to replace the placeholder code snippets with your actual implementation.
